# Development guide

This guide covers building Bridle, the quality gates every change must pass, and how the code is
organised. For the *why*, read [02-architecture.md](02-architecture.md).

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| JDK | 21 | Temurin recommended. Bytecode targets Java 17. |
| Android SDK | platform `android-37`, build-tools 36.1+ | Set `ANDROID_HOME` or `sdk.dir` in `local.properties`. AGP downloads missing packages if licences are accepted. |
| Python | 3.10+ | For `pre-commit` and helper scripts. |
| tmux | 3.0+ | `:core:tmux` integration tests drive a real tmux server. |

The Gradle wrapper (`./gradlew`) downloads the pinned Gradle version on first use.

## Everyday commands

```sh
./gradlew check                 # compile, unit + integration tests, ktlint, detekt
./gradlew koverVerifyBridle     # fail if coverage < 95% (lines AND branches)
./gradlew koverHtmlReportBridle # open build/reports/kover/htmlBridle/index.html
./gradlew ktlintFormat          # auto-fix formatting
./gradlew checkLicense --no-configuration-cache --no-parallel  # Apache-2.0-compatible deps only
```

## Quality gates

Every pull request must pass all of these in CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):

1. **Pre-commit hooks**: whitespace, YAML/TOML/JSON validity, merge markers, large files,
   private-key detection, [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) secret scanning,
   shellcheck.
2. **ktlint** (official Kotlin style) and **detekt** (complexity and smells, zero issues allowed).
3. **Tests**: JUnit 6 + Kotest assertions/property tests; Robolectric for Android code.
4. **Coverage ≥ 95%** for both **lines and branches** over handwritten code, merged across all
   modules (JVM modules plus the **debug** build of Android modules, Kover variant `bridle`) and
   measured with the JaCoCo engine via Kover. JaCoCo's Kotlin filters ignore
   compiler-generated members (default-argument bridges, data-class methods, serialization
   constructors). The only exclusions are generated sources: `BuildConfig`, `R`, Hilt/Dagger
   generated classes, Room `_Impl` classes and kotlinx.serialization `$serializer`s. Composable
   code is measured like any other, `@Preview` functions and `ComposableSingletons` lambdas
   included: exercise them from Robolectric Compose tests. Don't add exclusions to dodge the
   gate. Write the test.
5. **License check**: runtime dependencies must be on the allow-list in
   `config/license/allowed-licenses.json`. No GPL/AGPL.
6. **CodeQL** (`security-extended` queries) for Kotlin/Java.

### Local CI runtime

Workflows use fresh, one-job Ubuntu guests on the `kitefold-ghost` runner. The
controller keeps host credentials outside guests and supports Docker services
inside each guest. Existing coverage, license, release and security gates remain
required.

Runner runtime updates require boot, .NET, Java, Android SDK and network
qualification, followed by the application's mandatory CI and CodeQL gates.
Preserve normal JVM compilation settings and the complete Gradle assembly and
`security-extended` analysis. The controller retains bounded fatal JVM summaries
in private host logs for diagnosis of daemon crashes during builds or tracing.

### Pre-commit hooks

```sh
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install --hook-type pre-commit --hook-type pre-push
```

Commit hooks are fast: hygiene checks, secret scanning, ktlint. The pre-push hook runs the full
`check koverVerifyBridle`. To run every hook on the whole tree: `pre-commit run --all-files`.

## Module map

| Module | Kind | Responsibility |
|--------|------|----------------|
| `:core:model` | JVM | Domain types, validation, snippet templates |
| `:core:ssh` | JVM | SSH engine (sshj), host-key trust, shell quoting, ssh_config import, SFTP, port forwarding |
| `:core:tmux` | JVM | tmux command builders/parsers, launch/restart orchestration, helper protocol |
| `:core:session` | JVM | Shared per-host connections and reconnects, terminal tabs, Claude status monitor |
| `:core:terminal` | JVM | Key encoding, bracketed-paste sanitising, key-bar layouts, compose history |
| `:core:terminal-ui` | Android | `TerminalEngine` (termlib adapter), output coalescing, terminal screen state, key bar, compose box, status banner |
| `:core:backup` | JVM | Encrypted configuration backups, import merge planning, scrubbed crash reports |
| `:core:data` | Android | Room database, repositories, known-hosts store, backup import/export, DataStore settings |
| `:core:*` / `:feature:*` (Android) | Android | Keystore, terminal UI, screens, service |

Logic lives in JVM modules wherever possible: they are fast to test and easy to cover. Android
modules stay thin.

## Conventions

- **Keep Hilt entry points thin** (`@HiltAndroidApp`, `@AndroidEntryPoint` activities, services and
  receivers). Hilt's Gradle plugin rewrites their bytecode, so coverage recorded while they run
  can't be matched to the compiled classes and shows as 0%. Put the logic in injected classes
  (e.g. `SessionActions`, `SessionCoordinator`), where it is tested and measured. Entry points
  are still exercised by Robolectric tests.

- **Compose lambdas that capture a composable's parameters** (typically the ViewModel) are written
  `@DontMemoize { ... }` in the feature screens. Memoizing them gains nothing measurable on these
  screens, and the code the Compose compiler generates to memoize them branches on how *callers*
  pass each parameter, which no test can fully exercise. Lambdas that capture only locals are
  left memoized.

- `explicitApi()` is on for library modules, so public API is deliberate.
- Warnings are errors.
- Anything interpolated into a remote command **must** go through `ShellQuote` and be validated
  by `Validators`. Reviewers reject string-concatenated shell commands.
- Secrets never go in logs, exceptions, crash reports or the database (see `SECURITY.md`).
- Commits: imperative subject (≤ 72 chars), body explaining *why*.

## Toolchain

Gradle 9.8.2 (wrapper, checksum-pinned), Android Gradle Plugin 9.5 with built-in Kotlin,
Kotlin 2.4, KSP2, Hilt, Compose (BOM), Room, Robolectric for Android unit tests. Every plugin is
declared once in the root `build.gradle.kts` (`apply false`) so they share a classloader; the
convention plugins in `build-logic` (`bridle.jvm.library`, `bridle.android.library`,
`bridle.android.application`, `bridle.android.compose`, `bridle.hilt`, `bridle.quality`) hold all
shared configuration. Android unit tests run for the `debug` variant only; Android Lint runs
with warnings as errors (`config/lint.xml` holds the few scoped, justified suppressions).

## Working behind a restricted network

If Maven Central rate-limits you, point Gradle at a mirror with a user-level init script (do not
commit it), e.g. `~/.gradle/init.d/mirror.gradle` adding
`https://maven-central.storage-download.googleapis.com/maven2/` ahead of the default
repositories. Robolectric downloads its Android framework jars separately; point it at a mirror
with `bridle.robolectric.repoUrl=<url>` in `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`.
